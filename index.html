          Hello, I'm Sehrish, a psychologist with a passion for web development. I believe that combining my expertise
          in psychology with web development skills can help me create engaging and user-friendly online experiences. I
          have always been fascinated by how technology can enhance mental well-being and make information more
          accessible to people.

    <p>
      With a background in psychology, I have developed a deep understanding of human behavior, emotions, and mental
      processes. I have experience in counseling individuals dealing with various psychological issues, and I
      strongly believe in the power of empathy and effective communication to promote mental well-being. Through my
      work, I aim to help individuals lead fulfilling lives by providing them with the support they need.

      As a psychologist with a growing interest in web development, I am excited about the possibilities of merging
      these two fields. I enjoy creating visually appealing and intuitive websites that effectively convey
      information and engage users. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am continuously expanding my
      skills in front-end and back-end web development. Combining my knowledge of psychology and web development, I
      strive to build platforms that promote positive user experiences and contribute to the online community.
